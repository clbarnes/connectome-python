    "wdr-23": "wdr-23 encodes a WD40 repeat-containing protein; WDR-23 functions as part of a CUL-4/DDB-1 ubiquitin ligase complex that negatively regulates accumulation and hence, transcriptional activation activity of the SKN-1 transcription factor in intestinal nuclei; wdr-23 activity is thus required for regulation of stress resistance, longevity, and normal growth and development; WDR-23 physically interacts with DDB-1 and SKN-1, thus likely serving as a bridge between the ubiquitin ligase complex and its SKN-1 substrate; in regulating skn-1 function, wdr-23 appears to act downstream of the p38 MAPK pathway and together with gsk-3 and the daf-2-mediated insulin signaling pathway; WDR-23 is expressed in the intestine, hypodermis, and neurons, where it localizes to nuclei.",
    "wdr-5.1": "wdr-5.1 encodes a WD40 repeat-containing protein that is the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian WDR5, a member of a conserved H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) complex; WDR-5.1 functions to regulate H3K4 methylation levels and to negatively regulate adult worm lifespan; WDR-5.1 activity also antagonizes SynMuv transcriptional repressors; WDR-5.1 is broadly expressed beginning at the 20-cell stage of embryogenesis with continuing expression seen, albeit more restricted, through adulthood; WDR-5.1 localizes to the nucleus.",
    "wrk-1": "wrk-1 encodes, by alternative splicing, at least three isoforms of a GPI-anchored immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) protein orthologous to Drosophila KLINGON, WRAPPER, CG7166, and CG13506; WRK-1 is expressed in the pioneering embryonic motoneurons (eMNs)  DA, DB, and DD; WRK-1 expression in DA, DB, and DD is necessary and sufficient to prevent follower axons from inappropriately crossing the ventral midline; WRK-1 also retards developmental changes in the outward current of maturing AIY interneurons; in addition to eMNs and AIY neurons, WRK-1 is expressed in ASI and SMDV/D neurons, along with sheath and socket cells, intestine, the excretory gland cell, distal tip cells, and coelomocytes; wrk-1 transcription in AIY requires TTX-3, being greatly reduced in a ttx-3(ot22) mutant background; however, wrk-1 may not be transcriptionally activated by CEH-10/TTX-3 heterodimers, since wrk-1    lacks an AIY motif in its cis-regulatory sequences; WRK-1 binds VAB-1 or VAB-2 in vitro, and wrk-1(ok695) mutations fail to enhance vab-1 or a triple vab-2, efn-2, and efn-3 mutation, indicating that WRK-1 acts in  concert with ephrins; wrk-1(ok695) null mutants exhibit midline crossover defects in the axons of HSN, PVQ, AV-type, and PVC neurons; wrk-1(ok695) and wrk-1(tm1099) mutant neurons have normal whole cell capacitance but precociously altered their outward current from a slowly activating, sustained current to a rapidly-activating one; hypodermal   misexpression of WRK-1 induces defects in PVQ axonal outgrowth, which   are enhanced by a wrk-1(ok695) mutant background; wrk-1(ok695) mutations enhance sax-3(ky123), indicating that WRK-1 and SAX-3 act in parallel.",
    "xrn-2": "xrn-2 encodes a 5'-3' exoribonuclease orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rat1p; XRN-2 activity is required for degradation and hence regulation of levels of mature miRNAs such as let-7; accordingly, loss of xrn-2 activity affects miRNA-mediated processes such as molting, specifically shedding cuticle from the pharynx, and regulation of vulval development; an xrn-2::gfp promoter fusion is expressed in the pharyngeal myoepithelium, the intestine, and neurons.",
    "zig-1": "zig-1 encodes a predicted transmembrane protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins; a zig-1::gfp reporter fusion is expressed in most neurons, including the PVT interneuron, as well as in body wall muscle; zig-1::gfp expression begins during the L1 larval stage of development.",
    "zig-2": "zig-2 encodes a predicted secreted protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins; a zig-2::gfp reporter fusion is expressed in the PVT interneuron and weakly in 4-6 additional head neurons.",
    "zig-3": "zig-3 encodes a predicted secreted protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins; a zig-3::gfp reporter fusion is expressed in the PVT, AIM, and ASI neurons, as well as in the vulva and weakly in the body wall muscle.",
    "zig-4": "zig-4 encodes a predicted secreted protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins; ZIG-4 activity is required for maintenance of ventral nerve cord organization: the AVKL/R and PVQL/R axons of the left and right ventral nerve cords do not maintain their proper spatial positions and drift into the opposite cord; a zig-4::gfp reporter fusion is expressed in the PVT, ASK, BAG, and M2 neurons, with expression also seen during the L1 stage in pharyngeal mesoderm and ectoderm.",
    "zig-5": "zig-5 encodes a predicted secreted protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins; a zig-5::gfp reporter fusion is expressed in a number of neurons, including PVT, VD1-13, RID, AFD, ASK, RIV, RIB, PVQ, DVA, and RIS; zig-5::gfp is detected in the PVT neuron beginning at the three-fold stage of embryogenesis and continuing throughout larval development; loss of zig-5 activity in large-scale RNAi screens has been reported to result in low levels of embryonic lethality.",
    "zig-8": "zig-8 encodes a predicted secreted protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins; a zig-8::gfp reporter fusion is expressed in the PVT neuron and in pharyngeal muscle.",
    "ztf-3": "ztf-3 is predicted to have nucleic acid binding activity and metal ion binding activity, based on protein domain information.",
    "zyg-8": "The zyg-8 gene encodes a protein with a doublecortin-like domain and a protein kinase domain; mutations of zyg-8 impair mitosis at the one-cell embryonic stage, which is normally asymmetrical, but which fails to show proper asymmetry in zyg-8 mutant embryos."
